# Dynamic Programming and Baseball
This set of programs simulates a baseball game to analyze the strategies in various situations throughout a game. 

Original code was in MATLAB and I have since translated it to R for additional flexibility.

## Quick start guide
1. Download the .R programs to a single directory. 
2. Open up the "baseball dp.R" program and execute.
